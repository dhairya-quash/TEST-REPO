## Features

- Crash Logs: Automatically capture and log crashes in your application.
- Session Replays: Record user sessions to understand the steps leading to an issue.
- Network Logs: Capture all network requests and responses.
- Device Information: Collect detailed device information including OS version, device model, and more.
- Customizable Bug Reports: Allow users to report issues with custom fields and attachments.

# Installation

### **Dependencies**

Ensure your Android project is compatible with the Quash SDK by setting the **`minSdkVersion`** to 24 or higher. This requirement supports advanced functionalities such as session replay processing and encoding.

To resolve the Quash SDK dependency, your project needs access to the appropriate repositories. Add the following repository configuration to your project's **`build.gradle`** (Project level):

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Next, add the Quash SDK to your project by including the following line in your build.gradle (Module level) file:

```
implementation 'com.quashbugs:sherlock:<VERSION>'
```

Replace <VERSION> with the desired version of the Quash Android SDK.

This setup ensures that your build environment can fetch and manage all necessary dependencies from Maven Central, Google's repository, and other specified sources, facilitating a smooth integration process.

### **SDK Initialization**

Initialize the SDK at the beginning of your application's lifecycle, ideally in the **`onCreate`** method of your **`Application`** class:

```
Quash.initialize(
    context = this,
    applicationKey = "YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY",
    shouldReadNetworkLogs = true/false
);
```

**Parameters:**

- **Context (`this`)**: The application context.
- **Application Key**: A unique identifier generated for your application, used to authenticate your app with Quash services.
- **Network Logs Flag (`true`)**: Enables network logging to capture all network traffic, which can be crucial for debugging network-related issues.

### **Intercepting Network Requests**

To intercept and log network requests and responses within your application, add Quash's network interceptor directly to your **`OkHttpClient`** configuration. Here's how you can set it up:

```kotlin
val builder = OkHttpClient.Builder()
Quash.getInstance().networkInterceptor?.let { interceptor ->
    builder.addInterceptor(interceptor)
}
val client = builder.build()
```

This setup configures your **`OkHttpClient`** to capture all network transactions, which are essential for debugging network issues. Integrating the interceptor directly ensures that every network request and response goes through Quash, allowing for detailed logging and analysis in your bug reports.

### **Activation Mechanics**

Quash SDK is activated by a default gesture: shaking the device. This gesture brings up the bug-reporting interface, allowing quick and easy bug reporting.

### **Adding Firebase Plugins**

We need firebase plugin to get internal checks on sdk
Depending on your build system setup, you might need to add Firebase plugins in your `build.gradle` files. Here are two ways to do it:

### **_Option 1: In the buildscript section_**

Add the Firebase plugins in the `buildscript` section of your root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'  // Google Services plugin
        classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.2.0'  // Crashlytics plugin
    }
}
```

### **Option 2: In the plugins block**

Alternatively, use the plugins DSL in your app module `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services' version '4.3.3' apply false
    id 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics' version '2.2.0' apply false
}
```

Apply the plugins at the end of the app module build.gradle:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

### Configuration with `quash.properties`

Each module within the SDK includes a `quash.properties` file that you need to configure. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

### Setup Steps:

1. **Locate the File:**

   - Find the `quash.properties.example` file in each module's directory.
   - Specifically for the Quash module, locate the `google-service.json.example` file.

2. **Configure the Files:**
   - Rename `quash.properties.example` to `quash.properties` and edit it with your specific configuration parameters such as API keys or server URLs.
   - In the Quash module, rename `google-service.json.example` to `google-service.json` and update it according to your Firebase configuration needs.

```properties
# Example configuration entries
FirebaseApiKey=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
FirebaseAppId=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
FirebaseProjectId=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID

# Base URLs for different build environments
ReleaseBaseUrl=https://your_release_base_url.com
DebugBaseUrl=https://your_debug_base_url.com
```

**Secure Configuration:**

- Make sure to not expose sensitive information like API keys in public repositories. Use environment variables for sensitive data.

### Build Integration:

- Ensure that `build.gradle` is configured to include `quash.properties` during the build process.

This configuration file is crucial for each module to function correctly within your project.
