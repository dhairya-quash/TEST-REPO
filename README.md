Welcome to Quash! We're excited to introduce our next-generation mobile development tool designed to revolutionize the way you test and debug your applications. With Quash, identifying and resolving bugs is as easy as a shake of your device. Our intuitive platform auto-captures session replays, crash logs, and more, allowing you to focus on building new features while we handle the bugs.

## Community and Next Steps

We're currently working on a redesign of the application, including a revamp of the codebase, so Documenso can be more intuitive to use and robust to develop upon.

- Check out the first source code release in this repository and test it.
- Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Nxbe8F6aqw) server for any questions and getting to know to other community members.
