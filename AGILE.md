## 1. Introduction
In the dynamic world of startups, effective project management is crucial for success. This comprehensive guide outlines a robust approach to sprint planning, execution, and management using a flexible 5-7 day sprint cycle. By breaking down the development process into manageable chunks called "sprints," startups can maintain steady progress, adapt to changes quickly, and deliver value consistently.

## 2. Sprint Structure and Terminology
A sprint is primarily a 5-day working period, with the flexibility to extend to 7 days when necessary. The additional 2 days serve as a buffer and are only used when required to complete sprint goals or handle unexpected issues.

**Key terms:**
- **Sprint n**: The current active sprint (5 days, extendable to 7)
- **Sprint n+1**: The upcoming sprint, currently in planning
- **Sprint n+2**: The sprint after the next, in early planning stages
- **Sprint n-1**: The most recently completed sprint
- **Buffer Days**: Days 6-7, used only when necessary to complete sprint goals

## 3. Team Composition and Responsibilities
Three main teams collaborate in the development process:

1. **Product Team**
   - **Led by**: Product Manager
   - **Primary focus**: Sprint n+2 planning
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Define features and create user stories
     - Prioritize work
     - Communicate with stakeholders
     - Create acceptance criteria

2. **Design Team**

![Sprint Planning Diagram](https://images.ctfassets.net/xjcz23wx147q/2G4ETsoVBoQ9xMaUxMV1YL/1f39c726121862cad04ee4dbb4a6e8bb/sprint_20planning_20diagram.svg)

The teams work in a staggered approach to ensure continuous productivity:
- **Product Team**: Planning for Sprint n+2
- **Design Team**: Designing for Sprint n+1
- **Engineering Team**: Building what was designed for Sprint n

A typical 5-day sprint follows this structure, with the possibility of extending to 7 days:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0bd72a-0a3c-4ac8-b760-5b85e06cfa40)


1. **Day 1 (Monday): Sprint Planning**
   - Review Sprint n+1 designs
   - Finalize Sprint n goals
   - Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

2. **Days 2-4: Sprint n Core Execution**
   - Teams focus on their assigned tasks
   - Daily stand-ups to discuss progress and blockers

3. **Day 5 (Friday): Sprint Review and Retrospective**
   - Demonstrate completed work from Sprint n
   - Discuss successes and areas for improvement
   - Assess need for buffer days
   - If buffer days are not needed, finalize Sprint n+1 plans

4. **Days 6-7 (Monday-Tuesday of next week): Buffer Days (if needed)**
   - Complete unfinished tasks
   - Address unexpected issues or technical debt
   - Refine Sprint n+1 plans
   - If used, conduct final Sprint Review and Retrospective on Day 7

## 5. Story Points and Estimation
Story points are used primarily by the Engineering team to estimate effort required for tasks. They consider complexity, amount of work, and risk/uncertainty.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8fc6448-8052-4896-9dea-eed19bbd7c59)


**Story point scale**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- **1 point**: Very simple task (e.g., changing button text)
- **3 points**: Small task (e.g., adding a simple form field)
- **5 points**: Average task (e.g., adding a new form to a website)
- **13 points**: Complex task that might need to be broken down

**Rough time equivalents (may vary by team)**:
- 1 point ≈ 2-4 hours
- 3 points ≈ 1 day
- 5 points ≈ 2-3 days
- 8 points ≈ 3-4 days
- 13 points ≈ 5 days

When estimating, teams should primarily focus on what can be accomplished within the 5-day sprint, with the understanding that buffer days may be available if absolutely necessary.

## 6. Sprint Execution
During Sprint n, teams focus on completing their assigned tasks within the 5-day timeframe. Daily stand-ups and continuous communication are crucial for identifying any risks that might necessitate the use of buffer days.

**Key activities**:
- Daily stand-ups
- Continuous integration and testing
- Regular communication between teams
- Updating task statuses on team boards
- Assessing the need for buffer days at the end of Day 5

## 7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
UAT occurs throughout Sprint n, starting as soon as a feature is ready for testing.

**UAT Process**:
1. Complete a feature
2. Conduct internal testing
3. Allow real users to try the feature
4. Collect user feedback
5. Make changes based on feedback

## 8. Tools and Progress Tracking
### Primary Tools
1. **Jira**: For project management, sprint tracking, and progress monitoring
2. **Confluence**: For documentation and knowledge sharing
3. **Slack**: For team communication

### Team-Specific Boards in Jira
Each team should have their own board:
