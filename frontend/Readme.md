## Getting Started

### Note

> Quash Dashboard has a dependency on backend for providing the neccesary actions and data to go beyond the signin and signup page. So in order to use the dashboard or view any changes that you make in the dashboard, you need a working backend for it. To do so, you can either run the code manually or use a pre-built docker image. Please refer to the [Backend Setup](https://github.com/dhairya-quash/TEST-REPO/tree/main/backend) for detailed steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the parent repository and move to the frontend directory:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Oscorp-HQ/quash-max.git
   cd quash-max/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Using npm:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add necessary environment variables as shown in `.env.example`.

### Usage

1. **Run the development server:**
   Using npm:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

### Running With Docker:

1. Pull Max's frontend docker image from docker hub.

   ```bash
   docker pull quashbugs/quash-max-frontend:latest
   ```

2. Create a container without running.

   ```bash
   docker create --name max-frontend -p 3000:3000 quashbugs/quash-max-frontend:latest
   ```

3. Extract the `application.properties` file to configure environment variables.

   ```bash
   docker cp max-frontend:/app/frontend/.env.example ./.env.local
   ```

4. Edit the `.env.local` file on your local machine by adding your tokens and secrets and after that, mount it back to the container.

   ```bash
   docker cp ./.env.local max-frontend:/app/frontend/.env.local
   ```

5. Run the container.

   ```bash
   docker start max-frontend
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
